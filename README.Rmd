`geombeer` is a package that that creates cool images of refreshing alcoholic beverages and yummy bar food. This was mainly built for my [R Shiny](https://andrewcli.shinyapps.io/andrews_bar/) app but I think anyone can enjoy this package. The `ggplot2` package is used under the the hood to create these images. 

### What's in the package so far?

* `geom_beer()` creates a can of ice cold beer
* `geom_redwine()`creates a bottle of red wine
* `geom_whitewine()`creates a bottle of white wine
* `geom_gin()` creates a bottle of gin (aesthetics inspired by [Bombay sapphire](https://www.bombaysapphire.com))
* `geom_hotdog()`creates a yummy hot dog

### Installation

You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/andr3wli/geombeer) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("andr3wli/geombeer")
```

### Example: `geom_beer()`

This is how you create a cold one in r

```{r example}
library(ggplot2)
library(geombeer)

ggplot() +
  geom_beer() +
  theme_void()
```

### Example: `geom_gin()`

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_gin() +
  theme_void()
```

### Example: `geom_hotdog()`
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_hotdog() +
  theme_void()
```

### Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to [Georgios Karamanis](https://t.co/crHTOelx3S?amp=1)! He is the one who created the original hot dog and I modified his code to give it some friends. Georgios is super nice and I am grateful for his help and code.
