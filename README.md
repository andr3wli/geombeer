`geombeer` is a package that that creates cool images of refreshing
alcoholic beverages and yummy bar food. This was mainly built for my [R
Shiny](https://andrewcli.shinyapps.io/andrews_bar/) app but I think
anyone can enjoy this package.

### Whatâ€™s in the package so far?

  - `geom_beer()` creates a can of ice cold beer
  - `geom_redwine()`creates a bottle of red wine
  - `geom_whitewine()`creates a bottle of white wine
  - `geom_gin()` creates a bottle of gin (aesthetics inspired by [Bombay
    sapphire](https://www.bombaysapphire.com))
  - `geom_hotdog()`creates a yummy hot dog

### Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to [Georgios
Karamanis](https://t.co/crHTOelx3S?amp=1)\! He is the one who created
the original hot dog and I modified his code to give it some friends.
Georgios is super nice and I am grateful for his help and code.
