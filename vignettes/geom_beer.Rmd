## `geom_beer`

`geom_beer` is a function in the `geombeer` package which creates cool images of refreshing alcoholic beverages and yummy bar food. This was mainly built for my [R Shiny](https://andrewcli.shinyapps.io/andrews_bar/) app but I think anyone can enjoy this package. The `ggplot2` package is used under the the hood to create these images. 


## Installation
You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/andr3wli/geombeer) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("andr3wli/geombeer")
```

## Example
This function works with `ggplot2` to create an image of a nice cold beer. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_beer() +
  theme_void()
```
