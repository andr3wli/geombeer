## `geom_hotdog`

`geom_hotdog` is a function in the `geombeer` package which creates cool images of refreshing alcoholic beverages and yummy bar food. This was mainly built for my [R Shiny](https://andrewcli.shinyapps.io/andrews_bar/) app but I think anyone can enjoy this package. The `ggplot2` package is used under the the hood to create these images. 

## Installation
You can install from [GitHub](https://github.com/andr3wli/geombeer) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("andr3wli/geombeer")
```

## Example
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_hotdog() +
  theme_void()
```


## Acknowledgment
My friend [Georgios Karamanis](https://karaman.is) created the original function.
